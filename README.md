**This application** will allow a user to create a new tasks, assign them a title and due date , and choose a project for that task to belong to. The will need to use a text based user interface via the command-line. Once they are using the application, the user should be able to also edit , mark as done or remove tasks.They can also quit and save the current task list to the file, and then restart the application with the former state restored.
